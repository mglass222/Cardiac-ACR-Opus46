# Cardiac-ACR-UNI Development Log

Development history, design decisions, and implementation notes for the
Cardiac-ACR-UNI project.

---

## Project genesis

Created as a successor to the original ResNet-50-based Cardiac-ACR
patch classifier (the 2019–2021 codebase that was later refactored as
`Cardiac-ACR-2026`). Motivation: pathology-specific foundation models
published since 2024 outperform ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-50 by
5–15 AUROC points on patch classification, especially on rare classes
where single-split validation gives no signal (notably Hemorrhage,
which only appears on slide 150 in the current training set).

The design took two phases:

1. **Original plan (library reuse)** — depend on the 2026 repo as a
   pip-installable dependency, reuse its preprocessing modules, add
   UNI-specific modules on top. This got the first end-to-end
   pipeline built quickly.
2. **Refactor to standalone** — copy the needed preprocessing /
   annotation / counting modules into this repo, rewrite imports, and
   drop the 2026 dependency entirely. The project is now self-contained.

Both phases are captured below.

---

## Design decisions

### Backbone: UNI2-h (not UNI v1, not DINOv3)

- **UNI2-h** (`MahmoodLab/UNI2-h`): ViT-H/14, 681M params, 1536-dim
  CLS embeddings. Trained on 200M H&E/IHC patches from 300k
  Mass General Brigham slides with the full DINOv2 recipe.
- **UNI v1** would have been a valid fallback (ViT-L/16, 300M params,
  1024-dim) but UNI2-h is the current SOTA with no access or hardware
  obstacles for this project.
- **DINOv3** (Meta, general-purpose) was considered and rejected: the
  arXiv benchmark *"Does DINOv3 Set a New Medical Vision Standard?"*
  (2509.06467) explicitly documents that DINOv3's natural-image
  features degrade on WSIs, and no pathology-DINOv3 variant had been
  released as of April 2026.
- **Virchow2 / Phikon v2 / H0-mini / GenBio-PathFM** were surveyed but
  not chosen — UNI2-h has the clearest track record and access was
  already granted.

### Standalone architecture (no external package dependencies)

The final layout keeps every module this project uses inside the
`cardiac_acr/` package. Benefits:

- The project can be cloned and run with a single `pip install -e .`
  — no out-of-tree source dependency.
- The patch extraction script, training data split, preprocessing
  filters, tile scoring, patch filtering, 1R2 segmentation, and
  annotation writers are all in one place and evolve together.
- Shared config: one `config.py` replaces the original project's
  `cardiac_globals.py` and holds both preprocessing paths *and* UNI
  hyperparameters.

Drawback: this repo and the older 2026 repo are now source-level
siblings, not linked. A bugfix in one has to be consciously ported to
the other if it's still active. That's acceptable because the
ResNet-50 baseline in the 2026 repo is an artifact to compare against,
not a live pipeline that needs ongoing maintenance.

### Frozen backbone + head (not fine-tuning)

For UNI-family backbones on pathology downstream tasks, the published
evaluation protocol is: freeze the backbone, extract features once,
train a linear probe on the cached features. This:

- Matches the canonical benchmark numbers so results are comparable.
- Avoids the memory cost of backprop through ViT-H (would not fit on
  an 8 GB 2070 SUPER at any useful batch size).
- Makes training fast — minutes on CPU, seconds on GPU.
- Decouples the expensive step (encoding) from the cheap iterative
  step (head training), so head hyperparameter sweeps are free.

### Head: linear probe first, MLP as a diagnostic fallback

Default: `Linear(1536, 6)`. Chosen because:

- It's the canonical UNI benchmark setup — reported numbers in the
  literature are directly comparable.
- Minimal overfitting risk on a small dataset.
- If linear underperforms, training a 2-layer MLP
  (`Linear(1536→512) → ReLU → Dropout(0.4) → Linear(512→6)`) is a
  2-minute diagnostic that tells us whether the features need
  non-linear combination (MLP >> linear) or the backbone is the
  ceiling (MLP ≈ linear). Both cases are useful signals.

Selectable via `HEAD_TYPE` in `config.py`.

### Feature cache format

Per-split `.pt` files at `data/Features/{training,validation}.pt`:

```python
{
    "features": FloatTensor [N, 1536],
    "labels":   LongTensor  [N],
    "classes":  list[str]               # index-aligned with labels
}
```

Features encoded in bf16 autocast during the forward pass, cast back
to fp32 before leaving GPU, and stored as fp32. Reason: bf16 saves
memory during encoding (the expensive step) but fp32 is the right
dtype for head optimization (the cheap, sensitive step). Storage cost
of fp32 is minimal — at 1536 × 4 bytes = 6 KB per patch, even
hundreds of thousands of patches fit easily in memory.

## Implementation notes

### Backbone loading quirk: `init_values=1e-5` needed

The UNI2-h model card's `timm.create_model(...)` snippet omits the
`init_values` argument. The downloaded weights, however, contain
LayerScale parameters (`blocks.N.ls{1,2}.gamma`). Loading without
`init_values` produces:

```
RuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for VisionTransformer:
    Unexpected key(s) in state_dict: "blocks.0.ls1.gamma", ...
```

Adding `init_values=1e-5` (the same value UNI v1's card specifies)
fixes it. Noted in `uni_backbone.py` with a comment because the
upstream model card does not.

### VRAM at inference

Smoke-tested with `torch.randn(4, 3, 224, 224)` on an RTX 2070 SUPER:
peak VRAM 2.88 GB in bf16 autocast. Plenty of headroom — the default
encode batch size is 16, which lands around 4–5 GB. If that ever
bites, drop `ENCODE_BATCH_SIZE` in `config.py` to 8 or 4.

### `allow_empty=True` for ImageFolder

The Hemorrhage class is only annotated on one slide (slide 150 in the
current training set, 147 regions). With the paper's 80/20 per-slide
split, that slide goes to training and the Validation/Hemorrhage
folder ends up empty. Without `allow_empty=True`,
`torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` raises
`FileNotFoundError: Found no valid file for the classes Hemorrhage`.
The flag makes the loader accept empty class folders — the head still
learns Hemorrhage from training patches, but has no validation signal
for that class (which is an honest consequence of the data, not a bug).

### Class-balanced loss respects empty classes

`_class_weights()` in `train.py` uses the sklearn balanced formula
(`total / (num_classes * count_i)`) but assigns weight 0 to classes
with zero training patches. This prevents division by zero while
still giving reasonable weights to well-populated classes. For the
current split, all six classes have training patches — the zero-weight
path is defensive, not active.

### AdamW + cosine schedule + warmup

Upgrade from the original repo's plain Adam + fixed LR. AdamW +
cosine-with-warmup is the 2024–2026 default, simpler than staged
unfreezing, and well-suited to the small number of iterations we need
for a linear probe.

### Consolidated `config.py`

In the original Cardiac-ACR codebase, paths lived in
`cardiac_globals.py` and training hyperparameters were scattered
across `train.py` / notebook cells. Here they're all in one
`config.py`, grouped by purpose (preprocessing paths, patch library,
UNI outputs, classes, backbone, encoding, head, training). A single
file to change when retargeting the project to different data or
hardware.

### V1 scope: diagnosis only, no annotation writing in diagnose_wsi

`diagnose_wsi.py` stops after writing the per-slide diagnosis pickle.
The `annotate_png` and `annotate_svs` modules in this package are
fully ported from the original codebase and read from
`config.SAVED_DATABASE_DIR` — which is the same directory
`diagnose_wsi` writes to — so adding them to the main loop is a
one-line follow-up. Left out of V1 so the first end-to-end run
focuses on producing the diagnostic grade.

### Standalone refactor mechanics

Turning the library-dependent first build into a self-contained
package took five concrete steps:

1. **Copy preprocessing modules flat** into `cardiac_acr/` — no
   `core/` subpackage, no `preprocessing/` subpackage. Files live at
   the top level next to the UNI-specific modules. Modules copied:
   `slide`, `filter`, `tiles`, `tileset_utils`, `filter_patches`,
   `count_1r2`, `annotate_png`, `annotate_svs`, `openslide_compat`,
   `util`, `cardiac_utils`, `check_dependencies`, `extract_patches`,
   `create_training_sets`. The patch-library count helpers (the old
   `training/data_utils.py`) were renamed to `preprocess_data_utils.py`
   so the filename clearly reflects its role.

2. **Merge `cardiac_globals.py` into `config.py`** — not a second
   file. The original project's globals module contained only
   constants and paths, and keeping it separate would have meant
   every module had to choose between `from X import config` and
   `from X import globals`. One file is simpler.

3. **Rewrite imports via `sed`** — a small set of substitutions
   covers every form actually used in the codebase:
   ```
   from cardiac_acr import cardiac_globals as cg  →  from cardiac_acr import config as cg
   from cardiac_acr.training import X              →  from cardiac_acr import X
   from cardiac_acr.training.X import Y            →  from cardiac_acr.X import Y
   from cardiac_acr.X import Y                     →  from cardiac_acr.X import Y  (e.g. util.Time)
   from cardiac_acr import X                       →  from cardiac_acr import X
   import cardiac_acr.X                            →  import cardiac_acr.X
   ```
   The submodule form (`from cardiac_acr.util import Time`) was the
   easiest to miss — the first sed pass only handled leading-line
   `from cardiac_acr import …` and let that pattern through. Caught
   on the import-walk verification.

4. **Drop the `cardiac-acr` dependency** from `pyproject.toml`; add
   the previously transitive deps (`opencv-python`, `scipy`,
   `scikit-image`, `openslide-python`) explicitly.

5. **Verify isolation** with two tests: (a) `pkgutil.walk_packages`
   imports every submodule under `cardiac_acr` with no errors,
   (b) `grep -rn 'cardiac_acr[^_]'` on the entire package directory
   returns no matches. Both passed on the final pass.

A gotcha worth remembering for future refactors of this kind: running
`pip uninstall cardiac-acr` (the name of the legacy package) via an
alias/typo can also uninstall `cardiac-acr-uni` if pip is ever given
a prefix match; after this refactor the UNI package was silently
uninstalled and had to be reinstalled. The `pip install -e .` line
in the README setup is the canonical recovery.

## Execution flow

### Module-level on import
`uni_backbone.UNIBackbone.__init__` → `timm.create_model("hf-hub:MahmoodLab/UNI2-h", ...)`
→ triggers `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download` if the weights aren't cached.
The model is moved to GPU and `eval()`'d; its parameters have
`requires_grad = False`.

### Patch preparation
```
extract_patches.main()              ← SVS + XML → PNGs under config.OPENSLIDE_DIR
create_training_sets.main()         ← split into config.TRAIN_DIR / config.VALID_DIR
```
Run in that order; they share no state beyond the on-disk patch tree.

## Session timeline

All dates 2026-04-21 unless noted.

1. **Design phase** — chose frozen backbone, linear probe first,
   UNI2-h over DINOv3 / UNI v1 / Virchow2 / Phikon v2 / GenBio-PathFM.
   Plan captured and iterated in a shared notes file.
2. **HF access granted** — user updated HF primary email to Duke
   institutional (UNI2-h rejects @gmail applicants), re-ran
   `hf auth login` after a token-in-chat incident → token rotated.
3. **Build phase (library-dependent form)** — nine tracked tasks:
   - Install timm + huggingface_hub
   - Verify HF auth + prime model download (2.7 GB, 5 files)
   - Add `pyproject.toml` to the 2026 repo for editable install
   - Scaffold `Cardiac-ACR-UNI/` with pyproject + gitignore + package
   - Write `uni_backbone.py` + smoke test (hit + fixed `init_values` omission)
   - Write `encode_patches.py`
   - Write `head.py` + `features_dataset.py` + `train.py`
   - Write `evaluate.py`
   - Write `diagnose_wsi.py`
4. **Standalone refactor** — user requested removing the external
   dependency so the project is self-contained. Six tracked tasks:
   - Copy preprocessing / annotation / counting modules flat into
     `cardiac_acr/` (no subpackage — per user direction).
   - Rewrite imports in the copied modules (initial sed missed the
     `from cardiac_acr.util import Time` submodule form — caught on
     the import walk, fixed with a targeted second pass).
   - Rewrite imports in the top-level UNI modules (`config`,
     `prepare_patches`, `diagnose_wsi`).
   - Drop the `cardiac-acr` dependency from `pyproject.toml`; pull in
     previously transitive deps (`opencv-python`, `scipy`,
     `scikit-image`, `openslide-python`) directly.
   - Verify: `pkgutil.walk_packages` imports every submodule cleanly;
     `grep -rn 'cardiac_acr[^_]'` returns no matches in the package.
   - Update README and DEVELOPMENT_LOG for the new architecture.
   Smoke-test post-refactor: UNI2-h backbone still loads (681M params,
   (4, 1536) output, 2.88 GB peak VRAM in bf16).

---

## What's next (V2 candidates — pre-unification snapshot)

This list reflects the project's state *before* the unification
refactor. Items 3–6 still stand. Items 1–2 were partly addressed by
the refactor; the updated follow-up list lives at the bottom of this
document under "Post-unification follow-ups".

1. **Wire up `annotate_png` / `annotate_svs`** in the per-slide loop
   so PNG overlays and SVS region annotations get written alongside
   the diagnosis pickles. *(Partly addressed: the slot exists in
   `wsi/diagnose.run()` but the annotation modules still read paths
   from shared `config` instead of the per-backend `BackendClassifier`;
   see follow-ups.)*
2. **Head-to-head evaluation** against the original ResNet-50 checkpoint
   on the same validation split. *(Now trivially runnable: both
   backends live in the same package and share the validation split;
   just hasn't been executed yet.)*
3. **Per-slide confidence calibration** — UNI features + linear probe
   may produce very peaked softmax distributions, so
   `PREDICTION_THRESHOLD = 0.99` may need re-tuning.
4. **Stain-jitter or Macenko normalization** as an encoding-time
   augmentation (the only place augmentation matters in the frozen
   pipeline). Typically gives modest AUROC gains in H&E.
5. **Multi-crop / test-time augmentation** at encode time: average
   features over 4–8 random crops per patch. Very cheap with a frozen
   backbone; sometimes moves the needle.
6. **Periodic check for pathology-DINOv3 variants** — no such model
   existed as of this session. If one ships, swapping it in is a
   one-line change to `backends/uni/backbone.py` plus an `EMBED_DIM`
   update in `backends/uni/config.py`.

## 2026-04-21 — Shared `Image-Data/` across projects

Consolidated the large, backend-agnostic inputs (`WSI/`, `DeepHistoPath/`,
`Patches/`) into a sibling directory `../Image-Data/` used by both
`Cardiac-ACR-UNI` and `Cardiac-ACR-Resnet` (the renamed `Cardiac-ACR-2026`
repo). Each project's local `data/`
still owns its *outputs* — `Backend/`, `Saved_Models/`, and (UNI only)
`Features/`.

Both configs (`cardiac_acr/config.py`,
`cardiac_acr/cardiac_globals.py`) now define:

```python
SHARED_DATA_DIR = os.environ.get(
    "CARDIAC_ACR_SHARED_DATA_DIR",
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(PROJECT_ROOT), "Image-Data"),
)
```

and root `WSI_DIR`, `DEEP_HISTO_DIR`, `PATCH_DIR` there. Everything else
(models, pickles, annotated slides, feature caches) stays under local
`DATA_DIR`. Env var override lets the shared tree be relocated without
editing code.

Rationale: raw WSIs and the derived patch library are large and shared
by both projects — duplicating them wasted disk. Outputs diverge per
project and must stay separate.

---

## Plan: unify into a single project with pluggable backends

The preprocessing pipeline (`slide`, `tiles`, `filter`,
`filter_patches`, `extract_patches`, `create_training_sets`), the
WSI-level inference/annotation code (`diagnose_wsi`, `annotate_png`,
`annotate_svs`, `count_1r2`), and the utilities (`cardiac_utils`,
`util`, `check_dependencies`, `openslide_compat`, `tileset_utils`) are
duplicated nearly verbatim between `Cardiac-ACR-UNI` and
`Cardiac-ACR-Resnet`. Only training, evaluation, and the model
definition meaningfully differ:

- **2026 / ResNet-50**: end-to-end patch training with weighted
  cross-entropy, `ImageFolder` data loading, 5-fold cross-validation,
  per-threshold slide-level stats.
- **UNI**: frozen UNI2-h backbone → cached per-patch feature tensors
  → linear or MLP head trained in seconds on cached tensors.

**Plan**: collapse the two repos into a single package, `cardiac_acr`,
with a `backends/{resnet,uni}/` subpackage per model and a thin backend
contract so the WSI-level code is model-agnostic.

### Backend contract

Each backend exposes:

```python
def train(args) -> None: ...
def evaluate(args) -> dict: ...
def load_classifier(ckpt_path) -> Callable[[Tensor[B,3,224,224]], Tensor[B,C]]
```

`wsi/diagnose.py` takes a classifier callable as input and knows
nothing about whether it's a ResNet end-to-end forward pass or a UNI
backbone → head chain. Annotation, ROI filtering, and per-slide pickle
writing are untouched.

### CLI

python -m cardiac_acr preprocess {tiles,filter,extract-patches,split}
python -m cardiac_acr train        --backend {resnet,uni}
python -m cardiac_acr evaluate     --backend {resnet,uni} --checkpoint PATH
python -m cardiac_acr diagnose-wsi --backend {resnet,uni} --checkpoint PATH
python -m cardiac_acr count-1r2    ...
```

### Config split

- Top-level `config.py`: paths (`WSI_DIR`, `DEEP_HISTO_DIR`,
  `PATCH_DIR`, `BACKEND_DIR`, `SHARED_DATA_DIR` + env override),
  `CLASS_NAMES`, `NUM_CLASSES`, `IMAGENET_MEAN/STD`, `PATCH_SIZE`,
  `ANNOTATION_SIZE`, `SCALE_FACTOR`, `PREDICTION_THRESHOLD`,
  `BATCH_SIZE`, `_1R2_DILATION_ITERS`, `FONT_PATH`, `OPENSLIDE_BIN_PATH`.
- `backends/resnet/config.py`: `TRAIN_INPUT_SIZE`, `TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE`,
  `TRAIN_LEARNING_RATE`, `TRAIN_NUM_EPOCHS`, `TRAIN_DEFAULT_MODEL_NAME`,
  `MODEL_DIR`, `SAVED_DATABASE_DIR`, cross-val dirs, stats spreadsheet
  paths.
- `backends/uni/config.py`: `UNI_MODEL_ID`, `EMBED_DIM`, `INPUT_SIZE`,
  `ENCODE_BATCH_SIZE`, `ENCODE_NUM_WORKERS`, `HEAD_TYPE`,
  `HEAD_DROPOUT`, `HEAD_HIDDEN_DIM`, `TRAIN_*` (head-training),
  `FEATURE_DIR`, `MODEL_DIR`, `*_FEATURES_PATH`.

### Migration order

Each step must leave a working tree.

1. **Start from `Cardiac-ACR-UNI`.** It's already standalone with
   cleaner imports and post-refactor module boundaries.
2. **Carve out `backends/uni/`.** Move `uni_backbone.py` → `backbone.py`,
   `head.py`, `encode_patches.py`, `features_dataset.py`, `train.py`,
   `evaluate.py` into `backends/uni/`. Split UNI-specific constants out
   of `config.py` into `backends/uni/config.py`. Fix imports. Smoke-test
   UNI end-to-end.
3. **Reorganize shared code** into `preprocessing/`, `wsi/`, `utils/`.
   Pure rename + import-rewrite commit; no logic changes.
4. **Port `backends/resnet/`** from `Cardiac-ACR-Resnet`:
   `training/model.py`, `training/train.py`,
   `training/cross_validation.py`, `training/data_utils.py`,
   `training/extract_patches.py` (diff against UNI's copy — should be
   identical or near-identical), `stats/*`.
5. **Make `wsi/diagnose.py` backend-agnostic.** Refactor to take a
   `classify: Callable[[Tensor], Tensor]` argument. Provide
   `load_classifier` in both backends. Wire up the CLI dispatch.
6. **Rename** the project directory to `Cardiac-ACR` and archive
   `Cardiac-ACR-Resnet`. `Image-Data/` is already shared; no data
   movement required.

### Tradeoffs / risks

- One-time refactor touching ~20+ files; will break any out-of-tree
  scripts pointing into either repo.
- The train/evaluate paths stay as two separate files per backend;
  abstraction only lives at the WSI-inference boundary where it's
  cheap. This avoids a premature "universal trainer".
- If ResNet later wants the cached-feature flow (train a head on
  pre-computed features), that's a future add, not a blocker.
- Neither project has tests, so verification is smoke-test only:
  UNI encode+train+diagnose one slide; ResNet train one epoch on a
  small split and diagnose one slide.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Step 2 complete: `backends/uni/` carved out

Cardiac-ACR-Resnet is the renamed Cardiac-ACR-2026. That naming is the
final one going into the unified project.

UNI-specific modules moved into `cardiac_acr/backends/uni/`:

- `uni_backbone.py` → `backends/uni/backbone.py` (`UNIBackbone`)
- `head.py` → `backends/uni/head.py`
- `encode_patches.py` → `backends/uni/encode_patches.py`
- `features_dataset.py` → `backends/uni/features_dataset.py`
- `train.py` → `backends/uni/train.py`
- `evaluate.py` → `backends/uni/evaluate.py`

UNI-specific hyperparameters and paths moved out of `config.py` into
`backends/uni/config.py`: `UNI_MODEL_ID`, `EMBED_DIM`, `INPUT_SIZE`,
`ENCODE_BATCH_SIZE`, `ENCODE_NUM_WORKERS`, `HEAD_TYPE`, `HEAD_DROPOUT`,
`HEAD_HIDDEN_DIM`, `TRAIN_*` (head-training), `FEATURE_DIR`, `MODEL_DIR`,
`TRAINING_FEATURES_PATH`, `VALIDATION_FEATURES_PATH`.

`backends/uni/config.py` re-exports shared constants via
`from cardiac_acr.config import *` so modules can keep a single
import (`config as uni_cfg`) and reach both shared and UNI-specific
names. Downstream callers that previously did
`from cardiac_acr import config as uni_cfg` now do
`from cardiac_acr.backends.uni import config as uni_cfg` and
everything else is unchanged.

`diagnose_wsi.py` imports updated for the backend-scoped paths but
otherwise untouched; the backend-agnostic refactor (step 4) is next.

User-facing command paths updated in README and module docstrings:

```
python -m cardiac_acr.backends.uni.encode_patches
python -m cardiac_acr.backends.uni.train
python -m cardiac_acr.backends.uni.evaluate
```

Verification: `pkgutil.walk_packages` imports all 27 modules clean;
`uni_cfg.EMBED_DIM == 1536`, shared `WSI_DIR` re-exports via `uni_cfg`,
UNI-specific `MODEL_DIR` still points at `data/Saved_Models/UNI_Head/`.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Step 3 complete: shared code moved into subpackages

Backend-agnostic modules regrouped under three subpackages:

- `preprocessing/` — `slide`, `tiles`, `tileset_utils`, `filter`,
  `filter_patches`, `extract_patches`, `create_training_sets`,
  `preprocess_data_utils`, `openslide_compat`.
- `wsi/` — `diagnose` (was `diagnose_wsi`), `annotate_png`,
  `annotate_svs`, `count_1r2`.
- `utils/` — `cardiac_utils`, `util`, `check_dependencies`.

`diagnose_wsi.py` renamed to `wsi/diagnose.py`. No logic changes — only
imports and the `-m` command paths were rewritten. Config stays at the
package top level as `cardiac_acr.config`.

Import rewrites ran mechanically across 13 files using a one-shot
regex pass; user-facing command strings in 5 files updated too.
`pkgutil.walk_packages` imports all 30 modules clean.

New command paths:

```
python -m cardiac_acr.preprocessing.extract_patches
python -m cardiac_acr.preprocessing.create_training_sets
python -m cardiac_acr.backends.uni.encode_patches
python -m cardiac_acr.backends.uni.train
python -m cardiac_acr.backends.uni.evaluate
python -m cardiac_acr.wsi.diagnose
python -m cardiac_acr.utils.check_dependencies
```

README project-layout tree and command examples updated to match.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Step 4 complete: `backends/resnet/` ported

Cardiac-ACR-Resnet's training code copied into
`cardiac_acr/backends/resnet/`:

- `model.py` — `build_resnet()`, `unfreeze_layers()` (ResNet 18/34/50/101/152 factory with the modern `weights=` API).
- `train.py` — two-phase training (FC+BN only → unfreeze `layer3`/`layer4` with lr/9 and lr/3).
- `cross_validation.py` — 5-fold CV runner, writes per-fold checkpoints and aggregated predictions pickle.
- `data_utils.py` — `count_classes/patches`, `epoch_steps`, `class_weights`, `datasets_normalization`, `dataloaders` (the ResNet path trains on an `ImageFolder`, so the DataLoader helpers UNI dropped still matter here).
- `stats/` — `_stats_utils.py`, `dump_training_predictions.py`, `patch_level_stats.py`, `test_set_stats.py`, `training_set_stats.py`. Threshold-sweep CSVs and ROC/AUROC plots are written out under `TRAIN_SET_ANALYSIS_DIR` / `TEST_SET_ANALYSIS_DIR`.

`backends/resnet/config.py` re-exports shared constants
(`from cardiac_acr.config import *`) and adds ResNet-specific paths
and hyperparameters. All ResNet outputs nest under a `Weighted_Loss/`
subfolder so they don't collide with UNI outputs in the same `data/`
tree: `Saved_Models/Weighted_Loss/`,
`Backend/{Saved_Databases,Slide_Dx,Annotated_Test_Slides,Test_Slide_Predictions}/Weighted_Loss/`,
`WSI/TEST_SLIDE_ANNOTATIONS/Weighted_Loss/`. Cross-val workspace
(`CROSS_VAL_DIR`), spreadsheets, and patch-level prediction pickle are
ResNet-only and stay unsuffixed.

`extract_patches.py`, `create_training_sets.py`,
`preprocess_data_utils.py` are **not** re-ported — UNI's
`preprocessing/` copies are the canonical versions and both backends
share them. The ResNet repo's `cardiac_globals.py` -> `config.py`
mapping took care of every old import with a mechanical regex pass.

`matplotlib` added to `pyproject.toml` dependencies (needed by
ResNet stats plots).

Verification: `pkgutil.walk_packages` imports all 42 modules clean.
`rcfg.MODEL_DIR` resolves to
`data/Saved_Models/Weighted_Loss`; shared `TRAIN_DIR` resolves into
`../Image-Data/Patches/Training_Sets/Training` as expected.

Deferred to step 5 (backend-agnostic WSI diagnose): the ported
`cardiac_acr_diagnose_wsi.py` from the ResNet repo is not yet merged
into `wsi/diagnose.py`. That's the whole point of the next step — one
`diagnose.py` module that takes a classifier callable instead of
hard-wiring a specific backend.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Step 5 complete: backend-agnostic WSI diagnose + CLI

### Backend contract

`cardiac_acr/backends/__init__.py` now defines a
`BackendClassifier` dataclass and a `load_classifier(name, device,
checkpoint_path)` dispatcher:

```python
@dataclass
class BackendClassifier:
    name: str
    classify: Callable[[torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor]  # (B,3,H,W) → (B,C) logits
    classes: Sequence[str]
    transform: Callable                               # PIL → Tensor[3,H,W]
    device: torch.device
    saved_database_dir: str
    slide_dx_dir: str
    annotated_png_dir: str
    test_slide_predictions_dir: str
```

Each backend exposes a `classifier.py` with `load_classifier(device,
checkpoint_path=None) -> BackendClassifier`:

- `backends/uni/classifier.py`: loads UNI2-h + the trained head,
  returns a `classify` closure that runs backbone.encode + head.
- `backends/resnet/classifier.py`: `torch.load`s the full ResNet model
  pickle and returns a `classify` closure that calls it directly.

Both fill `BackendClassifier.{saved_database_dir, slide_dx_dir,
annotated_png_dir, test_slide_predictions_dir}` with the paths from
their own `config.py` so UNI writes unsuffixed and ResNet writes
under `Weighted_Loss/`.

### Refactored `wsi/diagnose.py`

- `run(backend, checkpoint_path=None)` — new entry point that loads
  a `BackendClassifier` and drives the whole pipeline.
- `classify_patches(slide_number, classifier)` — uses
  `classifier.classify` and `classifier.transform`; no backbone / head
  knowledge left.
- `diagnose(slide_number, classifier)` — reads / writes from
  `classifier.saved_database_dir` / `.slide_dx_dir`; iterates
  `classifier.classes` instead of hard-coding the 6 names.
- `count_1r2.main(slide_number, saved_database_dir)` — count_1r2 was
  the one shared module that read `cg.SAVED_DATABASE_DIR` directly;
  now it takes the dir as an explicit arg, passed through from
  `diagnose()`.

Kept the legacy `cg.SAVED_DATABASE_DIR` / `SLIDE_DX_DIR` /
`ANNOTATED_PNG_DIR` / `TEST_SLIDE_PREDICTIONS_DIR` /
`TEST_SLIDE_ANNOTATIONS_DIR` defaults in `config.py` because
`wsi/annotate_png.py`, `wsi/annotate_svs.py`, and
`utils/cardiac_utils.py` still read them. Those modules aren't yet
wired into `diagnose.run()` (V1 limitation), so the stale read is
harmless for now. When annotations are wired in they'll need the same
treatment as `count_1r2`.

### Unified CLI

New `cardiac_acr/__main__.py` exposes a single entry point:

```
python -m cardiac_acr preprocess {extract-patches, split}
python -m cardiac_acr train        --backend {uni, resnet}
python -m cardiac_acr evaluate     --backend {uni, resnet} [--checkpoint PATH]
python -m cardiac_acr diagnose-wsi --backend {uni, resnet} [--checkpoint PATH]
python -m cardiac_acr check-deps
```

Direct module entry points (`python -m cardiac_acr.backends.uni.train`
etc.) still work — `__main__.py` just forwards to them. Keeping both
so the CLI is convenient and the module paths remain addressable for
scripts / debugging.

### Verification

`pkgutil.walk_packages` imports all 45 modules clean.
`load_classifier("bogus")` raises `ValueError` as expected.
`python -m cardiac_acr --help` lists every subcommand.
`python -m cardiac_acr diagnose-wsi --help` exposes `--backend` and
`--checkpoint`.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Step 6 complete: package renamed to `cardiac_acr`

The Python package was renamed in place:

- `cardiac_acr_uni/` → `cardiac_acr/` (directory rename).
- Every `cardiac_acr_uni` reference in source, docs, README, and
  pyproject rewritten to `cardiac_acr` via a one-shot regex pass (40
  files touched).
- `pyproject.toml`: `name = "cardiac-acr"`, `version = "0.2.0"`,
  description updated to mention both backends.
- `cardiac_acr/__init__.py` and README title updated to reflect the
  unified scope.
- Venv re-installed the package: `pip install -e .` picked up the new
  name. Import of the old `cardiac_acr_uni` now fails, as expected.

**What was intentionally not renamed**: the repo's containing
directory is still `Cardiac-ACR-UNI/`. Renaming it would have broken
the in-place `.venv` (absolute paths in activate scripts, shebangs,
etc.). The README still references `Cardiac-ACR-UNI` as the repo
directory — user can rename at their leisure and recreate the venv.

**Archive decision**: `Cardiac-ACR-Resnet/` is kept in place as a
sibling directory. It's no longer imported by anything in the new
`cardiac_acr` package — the ResNet code was copied in (not linked) —
so it's functionally archived already. Deletion / relocation is left
to the user to avoid touching directories outside the current project
without explicit authorization.

Final package layout:

```
cardiac_acr/
├── __init__.py  __main__.py
├── config.py                  # shared paths + preprocessing constants
├── preprocessing/             # slide / tile / patch pipeline
├── wsi/                       # backend-agnostic diagnosis + annotation
├── utils/                     # cardiac_utils, util, check_dependencies
└── backends/
    ├── __init__.py            # BackendClassifier + load_classifier()
    ├── uni/                   # UNI2-h frozen backbone + head
    └── resnet/                # ResNet-50 end-to-end
        └── stats/             # threshold-sweep CSVs, ROC/AUROC plots
```

45 modules import clean. The full refactor is complete.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Repo directory rename

User attempted renaming the containing repo directory from
`Cardiac-ACR-UNI/` to `Cardiac-ACR/`, then reverted it to finish this
dev-log update. The `.venv` inside would need recreation after a rename
because absolute paths are baked into activate scripts and shebangs:

```bash
rm -rf .venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

No code changes are needed — nothing inside the package references the
containing directory name.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Repo directory renamed

User completed the rename: `Cardiac-ACR-UNI/` → `Cardiac-ACR/`. README
references updated (clone target, data-path examples, `cd` command,
project-layout tree). No code changes required. `.venv` needs
recreation per the prior entry if the rename was done in place.

The stale `cardiac_acr_uni.egg-info/` at the repo root is a leftover
from the pre-rename editable install; `pip install -e .` after venv
recreation will replace it with `cardiac_acr.egg-info/`, and the old
directory can be removed.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Venv rebuilt, tech-debt items 1–3 resolved

**Venv recreated** against the renamed directory — old `.venv` had
`Cardiac-ACR-UNI` baked into `activate`/shebangs. After
`rm -rf .venv cardiac_acr_uni.egg-info`, new venv + `cu124` torch +
`pip install -e .`, all 31 modules import clean; torch sees the
2070 SUPER.

**Tech debt 1 + 2 (parametrize annotate/CSV helpers).**

- `wsi/annotate_png.py`: `annotate_png(slide_number, saved_database_dir, annotated_png_dir)` and `main(...)` mirror the `count_1r2.main` signature. Reads pickle from `saved_database_dir`, writes PNG under `annotated_png_dir/CONFIDENCE <pct>%/<slide>.png`.
- `wsi/annotate_svs.py`: `annotate_slide(slide_number, saved_database_dir, test_slide_annotations_dir)` and `load_diagnoses(slide_number, saved_database_dir)` take explicit paths.
- `utils/cardiac_utils.py`: `model_prediction_dict_to_csv(slide_number, saved_database_dir, test_slide_predictions_dir)` and `slide_dx_to_csv(slide_dx_dict, filename, slide_dx_dir)` take explicit paths.
- Fixed several pre-existing `cg.<DIR> + filename` concatenation bugs in the same functions (missing path separator) — they were dormant because the helpers weren't being called, but the parametrized versions would hit the same bugs the first time they were turned on.

**`BackendClassifier`** gained a `test_slide_annotations_dir` field (alongside the existing `saved_database_dir`, `slide_dx_dir`, `annotated_png_dir`, `test_slide_predictions_dir`), so the annotate_svs wiring is ready whenever `wsi/diagnose.run` is extended to call it.

**Missing HSV helpers in `preprocessing/filter.py`.** `tiles.py:978-1000`
(`rgb_to_hues`, `hsv_saturation_and_value_factor`) calls
`filter.filter_rgb_to_hsv`, `filter_hsv_to_h`, `filter_hsv_to_s`,
`filter_hsv_to_v`. None of the four were defined in either the UNI or
the ResNet project's `filter.py`, so the first real run of
`wsi/diagnose` tripped an `AttributeError` inside `score_tile`. The
authoritative implementations were found in the archived
`/media/.../Cardiac_ACR/Py_Files/filter.py` (original DeepHistoPath
derivation) and ported verbatim — skimage-based (`sk_color.rgb2hsv`),
matching the rest of filter.py's skimage style. Added
`import skimage.color as sk_color` to the header.

Reference: `/media/mglass222/AI Stuff - EVO 860/Cardiac_ACR/Py_Files/`
holds the pre-refactor, pre-package-ification originals for every
module. Useful when a call site references a function that neither
of the merged projects retained.

**Tech debt 3 (move backend paths out of shared config).**

- Dropped `SAVED_DATABASE_DIR`, `SLIDE_DX_DIR`, `ANNOTATED_PNG_DIR`, `TEST_SLIDE_PREDICTIONS_DIR`, `TEST_SLIDE_ANNOTATIONS_DIR` from top-level `cardiac_acr/config.py`.
- Added them explicitly to `backends/uni/config.py` (defaults match the previous shared values — UNI owns the unsuffixed tree). `backends/resnet/config.py` already defined them under `Weighted_Loss/`.
- No consumers still read these from the shared config; the annotate/CSV helpers get them as args via the `BackendClassifier`.

---

## Post-unification state

### What the codebase looks like now

One package, two backends, one CLI:

```
Cardiac-ACR/                        # repo directory

```

Shared input data (`WSI/`, `DeepHistoPath/`, `Patches/`) lives in the
sibling `../Image-Data/` directory, resolved via `SHARED_DATA_DIR`
(env-overridable with `CARDIAC_ACR_SHARED_DATA_DIR`). Each backend's
outputs land under the local `data/` tree — UNI unsuffixed, ResNet
under a `Weighted_Loss/` subfolder — so both backends can run against
the same working copy without colliding.

### Deliberate deferrals

- **`Cardiac-ACR-Resnet/` on disk.** Untouched. Its training code was
  *copied* into `backends/resnet/`, not linked, so it's functionally
  archived. Deletion / relocation is a user call.

### Known tech debt (post-refactor)

1. ~~**`wsi/annotate_png.py` and `wsi/annotate_svs.py`** still read
   `cg.SAVED_DATABASE_DIR` / `cg.ANNOTATED_PNG_DIR` /
   `cg.TEST_SLIDE_ANNOTATIONS_DIR` from the top-level `config`.~~
   **Resolved 2026-04-21.** Both modules now take `saved_database_dir`
   (and `annotated_png_dir` / `test_slide_annotations_dir`) as args.
2. ~~**`utils/cardiac_utils.py` CSV helpers**~~
   **Resolved 2026-04-21.** `model_prediction_dict_to_csv` and
   `slide_dx_to_csv` take path args. Pre-existing
   `cg.<DIR> + filename` concatenation bugs fixed.
3. ~~**Shared config still carries backend-specific defaults.**~~
   **Resolved 2026-04-21.** `SAVED_DATABASE_DIR`, `SLIDE_DX_DIR`,
   `ANNOTATED_PNG_DIR`, `TEST_SLIDE_PREDICTIONS_DIR`,
   `TEST_SLIDE_ANNOTATIONS_DIR` now live only in each backend's own
   `config.py`.
4. **Minor duplication between `preprocessing/preprocess_data_utils.py`
   and `backends/resnet/data_utils.py`.** Both define
   `count_classes` / `count_patches`. The ResNet copy has additional
   DataLoader-shaped helpers (`class_weights`, `datasets_normalization`,
   `dataloaders`, `epoch_steps`) that UNI dropped when it moved to
   feature-cache training. Acceptable for now; a one-line re-export
   from the backend side would clean it up.
5. **No tests.** Verification so far has been import smoke-tests +
   CLI `--help`. Real runs will produce the first end-to-end signal.
   Minimum viable test: run `preprocess` then `train --backend uni`
   on a small slide subset; then the same with `--backend resnet`;
   then `diagnose-wsi --backend {uni,resnet}` on one slide each and
   confirm the per-slide dx pickles exist in the right directory.

### Post-unification follow-ups (replaces the V2 list at the top)

In rough priority order:

1. **End-to-end smoke run** with the new CLI against a small slide
   set, one backend at a time. First use of the unified CLI — will
   shake out any remaining integration bugs (e.g., annotate paths, CSV
   helpers) that static import tests miss.
2. **Head-to-head UNI vs ResNet** on the same validation split. The
   whole point of keeping both backends alive. Produces the concrete
   numbers that justify the UNI rewrite (or don't).
3. **Fix the tech-debt items 1–3 above** — parametrize `annotate_png`
   / `annotate_svs` / `cardiac_utils` CSV helpers, then drop backend-
   specific paths from shared config. Unblocks turning on annotations
   for the ResNet backend.
4. **Per-slide confidence calibration** — carried over from the V1
   list; still relevant.
5. **Stain-jitter or Macenko normalization** / **multi-crop TTA at
   encode time** — carried over; UNI-backend-only tweaks.
6. **Periodic check for pathology-DINOv3 variants** (carried over).

## 2026-04-22 — Consolidated `Image-Data/` back into `data/`

Reversed the 2026-04-21 split. `WSI/`, `DeepHistoPath/`, and `Patches/`
moved from the sibling `../Image-Data/` tree back under the project's
local `data/` directory. `Cardiac-ACR-Resnet` is no longer sharing
these inputs, so the cross-project shared-directory mechanism has no
remaining consumer.

`cardiac_acr/config.py` changes:

- Removed `SHARED_DATA_DIR` and the `CARDIAC_ACR_SHARED_DATA_DIR` env
  override.
- `DEEP_HISTO_DIR`, `WSI_DIR`, and `PATCH_DIR` now resolve under
  `DATA_DIR` (`<PROJECT_ROOT>/data`) alongside `BACKEND_DIR` and the
  per-backend output dirs.
- Module docstring simplified — all inputs and outputs live under
  `DATA_DIR`.

No other code referenced `SHARED_DATA_DIR`; the variable was only
read inside `config.py`. Historical log entries above still describe
the shared-dir layout as it existed on 2026-04-21.

---

## 2026-04-22 — DataLoader-fed WSI classification (~4× GPU utilization)

`wsi.diagnose.classify_patches` was a serial loop: open PNG → PIL
decode → transform → `torch.stack` → `classifier.classify`. `nvidia-smi
dmon` during a live run showed **~25% SM util averaged** (bursting to
40% during the forward pass, dropping to 6–16% while the main thread
loaded the next 64 patches). The GPU was idle ~75% of the time.

**Change.** Replaced the manual loop with a `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`
fed by a tiny `_PatchFileDataset` that does PIL decode + transform in
worker processes. Configured `num_workers=8`, `pin_memory=True`,
`shuffle=False`. Added `tqdm` progress bar with batch rate and
accumulated-patch count in the postfix.

**Measured impact.** Post-change `nvidia-smi dmon` on the same
machine (RTX 2070 SUPER, fp16 autocast on ViT-H/14):

```
before:  sm 6–40% (mean ~25%), bursty
after:   sm 97–98% flat, zero idle gaps
```

~4× GPU-feeding efficiency. Per-slide classify time drops by roughly
the same factor. At 98% SM util we're at the Turing fp16 ceiling for
UNI2-h encode (~66 img/s in the training-side benchmark); further
wins require either hardware upgrade (5090 / H-series) or the streaming
inference refactor outlined in `PERFORMANCE_IDEAS.md` §1, which
would only marginally improve on the current state since IO is no
longer the bottleneck.

**Code.** `cardiac_acr/wsi/diagnose.py` — added `_PatchFileDataset`
and `_CLASSIFY_WORKERS = 8`; rewrote `classify_patches` to iterate a
DataLoader with a tqdm wrapper.

## 2026-04-22 — Quieted filter-module stdout

The preprocessing filter modules (`preprocessing/filter.py`,
`preprocessing/filter_patches.py`, and `utils/util.np_info`) printed
hundreds of lines per slide during the per-slide loop — every filter
step announced its shape/dtype/timing, and the overmask-retry logic
recursed with a debug `print` per step. During a diagnose run this
drowned out the `tqdm` classification bar and the per-slide progress
markers we actually care about.

**Change.** Added `VERBOSE = False` (plus `log(msg)` helper) to
`cardiac_acr/utils/util.py`. Routed all `print` calls in
`preprocessing/filter.py` and `preprocessing/filter_patches.py` —
np_info shape/time output, slide-processing banners, save-image
timings, task assignments, done markers, and the overmask-retry
prints — through `util.log()`. `np_info` itself early-returns when
not verbose. Flip `util.VERBOSE = True` to restore the original
chatter for debugging.

High-level progress (`\n=== slide N ===`, per-slide timing, classify
`tqdm` bar, thresholded kept-fraction, dx summary) is printed directly
from `wsi/diagnose.py` and is not gated by the flag — so the terminal
stays readable without losing the top-level signal.

## 2026-04-22 — Progress-bar polish and deterministic slide order

Follow-up polish on the diagnose pipeline's live UX.

**Single classify bar was doubling and bleeding across lines.** The
initial tqdm integration called `progress.set_postfix(patches=...)`
after every batch, which forces a second refresh per tick — the
terminal showed two bars per batch. Bars also rendered wider than the
actual terminal, so each `\r` landed mid-line and updates concatenated
instead of overwriting. Fix: dropped `set_postfix` (batch count is
already visible), added `dynamic_ncols=True` so tqdm re-queries
`$COLUMNS` on each refresh, and `mininterval=0.5` to cap the redraw
rate.

**Added outer slides bar.** `run()` now wraps the per-slide loop in a
top-level `tqdm(slides_to_process, desc="slides", position=0)`, so
the terminal shows two stacked bars: outer for total progress (with
slides/min ETA for the full run) and inner for the current slide's
classify batches (`position=1, leave=False` so each finished slide's
bar clears and the outer bar stays pinned). The per-slide
"done in Xs" summary uses `tqdm.write()` so it prints cleanly above
the live bars.

**Deterministic slide order.** `utils.get_test_slide_numbers()` used
to return slides in whatever `os.listdir` gave — filesystem
insertion/inode order, not numeric. On this machine the actual run
started `139, 260, 183, 161, …`, which makes "resume from slide N"
semantically awkward. Added `slide_list.sort()` so runs always
process in ascending slide number. Only affects iteration order;
the set of processed slides is unchanged.

**Code.**
- `cardiac_acr/wsi/diagnose.py` — tqdm kwargs updated on the
  classify bar; outer slide tqdm added in `run()`.
- `cardiac_acr/utils/cardiac_utils.py` — `slide_list.sort()` added
  before return in `get_test_slide_numbers`.

## 2026-04-23 — Fused tissue filter into the classify DataLoader

**Motivation.** After 2026-04-22's DataLoader switch, the per-slide
loop still ran three passes over every patch: `tileset_utils` wrote
~25k 224×224 PNGs; `filter_patches_multiprocess` read each one,
computed tissue %, and `os.remove`'d the rejects; then
`classify_patches` opened every survivor again. Non-tissue patches
were pure overhead — written, read, deleted; tissue patches were read
twice. (See `PERFORMANCE_IDEAS.md` item #3.)

**Change.** `_PatchFileDataset.__getitem__` now runs the same tissue
check the old pass ran (`filter_patches.apply_image_filters` +
`tissue_percent`) on the numpy RGB it already decoded, and returns a
`(path, None)` sentinel for patches under 50% tissue. A new
`_drop_empty_collate` is handed to the DataLoader; it filters the
sentinels out of each batch and stacks whatever's left, returning
`([], None)` for fully-empty batches. `classify_patches` skips those.

Because `util.VERBOSE` is already `False` (set in 2026-04-22's
"Quieted filter-module stdout" change), `apply_image_filters` runs
silently in the workers — no per-patch log spam across 8 processes.

**Semantics.**
- Same 50%-tissue cutoff as before; same `apply_image_filters` used as
  the mask source, so rejection decisions are identical.
- Rejected PNGs are no longer deleted from disk during the run. They
  get overwritten the next time `tileset_utils` rebuilds that slide's
  split-tile dir. No other code path depends on their absence.
- `classify_patches`'s end-of-slide log now reads
  `"kept X/Y tissue patches ..."` instead of the raw write count.
- `filter_patches_multiprocess` local helper deleted from
  `wsi/diagnose.py`. `preprocessing/filter_patches.py` itself is
  untouched — `apply_image_filters` and `tissue_percent` are imported
  directly by the dataset; nothing else imports the module now, but
  its public surface is preserved in case a future caller wants the
  standalone tissue-fraction dict.

**Code.**
- `cardiac_acr/wsi/diagnose.py` — dataset does tissue filter + sentinel
  return; `_drop_empty_collate` added; `DataLoader(collate_fn=...)` set;
  classify loop handles empty batches; `filter_patches_multiprocess`
  helper and its call from `run()` removed; module docstring updated.

**Expected impact.** One fewer per-slide pass through the patch dir
(removes the `filter_patches_multiprocess` cost entirely), one fewer
read of every tissue patch, no `os.remove` syscalls mid-run. On SSD
this is modest; on HDD/NFS it is more noticeable. The change also
shrinks the scope of the streaming refactor (`PERFORMANCE_IDEAS.md`
#1) since the tissue check is already colocated with the classify
dataset.

**Measured on slide 139 (2070 SUPER, SSD).** 39,925 patches / 344.1s
classify → 116 patches/s at the dataset level (tissue-rejected patches
never hit the GPU). Of those, 25,540 (64%) passed the 50% tissue
check, giving ~74 tissue-patches/s through UNI — modestly faster than
2026-04-22's ~66 img/s on the same hardware, with the separate filter
pass eliminated. At `PREDICTION_THRESHOLD=0.99`, 9,211 / 25,540 patches
(36%) cleared the top-softmax cutoff. Dx came out `2R` (driven by the
1R2 focus count from the segmentation pipeline).
